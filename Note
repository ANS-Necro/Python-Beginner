#Please not that in the Fizz-Buzz program, the error that has been shown is due to the fact that I have initialized a list 'l' outside of the code block.
#Initialize the list inside it, and we are good to go!

l = range (1,101) #initialize here
for i in l:
    if i%3==0 and i%5==0:
        print 'FizzBuzz'
    elif i%3==0:
        print 'Fizz'
    elif i%5==0:
        print 'Buzz'
    else:
        print i
